                            <li>Significant Impact of COVID-19: Both charts highlight the dramatic drop in passengers during 2020, followed by a rapid recovery starting in 2021. This reflects the severe impact of the pandemic on air travel.</li>

                    <li><strong>Dominance of Southwest Airlines (WN):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Both the original and updated charts clearly show Southwest (WN) consistently leading in terms of passenger volumes since the early 2000s, peaking at over 250,000 passengers per quarter in some years.</li>
                            <li>Conclusion: Southwest Airlines' market dominance is significant and has remained relatively stable even through periods of economic downturn.</li>

                            <li>Delta Airlines (DL) shows a notable increase in passenger volumes, particularly post-2010, which highlights its growing market presence.</li>
                            <li>American Airlines (AA), although smaller than Southwest Airlines, shows strong, steady growth over time, particularly from the mid-2000s onward.</li>

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Impact of Airline Mergers and Market Exits:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Some airlines, such as Continental Airlines (CO), are present in the earlier data but drop off later due to mergers (e.g., Continental merged with United Airlines in 2012).</li>
                            <li>The airline industry has seen significant consolidation over the years, with key mergers leading to market reshuffling and stronger dominance by a few major carriers.</li>

                    <li><strong>Pandemic Disruption Across All Airlines:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The charts clearly show the steep decline in passengers for all airlines during the pandemic in 2020. However, some airlines, such as Delta (DL), show a quicker recovery compared to others.</li>

                            <li>There is a wide variety of smaller airlines with fluctuating trends over the years. Carriers like Alaska Airlines (AS) and Frontier Airlines (FF) maintained smaller but consistent passenger bases.</li>
